				Story
			</h3>
				<p>
					Elsword and his big sister, Elesis, were enjoying an ordinary day, when an unexpected change came about. Elesis had received a reinforcements request from the Velder Army, which required her immediate departure. Elsword tried to persuade her to let him fight alongside her and their father, but failed. She ensured him that the next time they meet, he will have become much stronger, and reluctantly walked away to fulfill her duty.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elsword was alone, lamenting about the circumstances as he laid upon his bed, reminiscing about his family. His father was one of the best knights of the kingdom, and his sister a highly desired talent, and there he sat alone, feeling weak and helpless. Wishing he was stronger, he grabbed his sword, and began to train relentlessly, day after day, swearing that he will become strong enough to protect everyone. With every bit of progress he made, his face filled with a smile as he recalled his sister's words of encouragement, knowing that someday he would join his family in battle at last.

Raven was later adopted by one of Velder's most powerful commanders, General Cronwell. He raised Raven to be an expert swordsman. He attended a prestigious military academy but once word of his commoner upbringing became known, many of the students began to discriminate against him, birthing his hatred for nobles. During the academy's Mock Siege Warfare, Raven saved a student named Owen, a brilliant tactician who was bullied by other students.

				<p>
					Elesis possesses the gauge of Chivalry, similar to her younger brother Elsword's "Way of the Sword" gauge. Elesis fuels this gauge best offensively, with both basic attacks and skills. Depending on the types of attacks used to fill the gauge, a corresponding aura will activate once completely filled. Activation of the gauge will give her one of the two auras: Spirit of Annihilation or Aura of Gale. Spirit of Annihilation will make Destruction skills and commands automatically deal Critical damage and ignore Guard while Aura of Gale reduces the MP cost and cooldown time of Gale skills.

					As the son of Helputt, Hamel's White Coloussus, Chung faced heavy scrutiny from others who felt he was unfit to be part of the Seiker family lineage. With his feminine appearance and recurring sickness, many doubted his abilities, although his father held tremendous confidence in his young son. By tradition, Chung was given a guardian stone on his birthday, which would resonate with him and eventually grant him a weapon and armor suited for him.Chung endured a lot of bullying due to his appearance and lack of strength, causing him grief and pushing him to train harder with his father to prove himself, but the bullying left him without any confidence. Helputt spoke with him, telling his own life story that was identical with Chung's experiences thus far. Chung felt a new sense of confidence from his father's tale, feeling that he too can overcome his shortcomings, and fulfill his dream of becoming a great warrior.As Chung approached the altar to receive his weapon and armor from the guardian stone, his fear was gone. He was granted a full suit of white armor, which he named Freiturnier, and a giant cannon, which he named Destroyer.

Remembering her brother's words of encouragement, she managed to defeat the Zhen family participants, earning the Haan family the final victory of the sparring contest.
