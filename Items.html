				Mounts
			</h3>
				<p>
					The mount system allows you to hop onto powerful mounts that you can ride to help you progress through dungeons.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mounts come with a number of unique features and abilities to aid you in combat. While riding your mount, your skills will change into Mount Attack Skills. Each Mount has a different set of skills available, and they can be used by pressing the [Z], [X], [C] buttons. Each mount controls and moves differently, and has their own individual perks. One such example, is that the Cockatrice can double jump while the Ponggo Scorpion TYPE-R is able to air-dash and glide. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The mount's damage output is taken from the average of your Physical and Magical AttackThe cooldown and MP cost of each type of mount attack will be identical [Z] attacks have no cooldown, [X] attacks have a 5 second cooldown and [C] attacks have a 10 second cooldown and requires 250 MP.
				</p>
			<h3>
				Pets
			</h3>
				<p>
					Pets are alies that helps you in battle(attacking), gives you stats(pet's pasive) and also can pick up for you all the items drops in dungeons.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pets will grow as you feed them with El tree seeds, El tree fruits, Equipments, Special jellies and Mysterious weeds.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pets will accept equipment of any level, although the amount of hunger replenished decreases based on the level difference between your character and the equipment.The better the equipment, the greater the hunger replenishment. Weapons replenish their hunger much greater than regular armor.Once the pet's Affinity is over 70%, your pet will enter a state called "Special Mode" It can be identified by the prefix Special on the pet's name once he enters that state.During Special mode, the pet will only accept El Tree Seeds or El Tree Fruits and will no longer accept any equipment until it reaches its next level.If you would like to remove "Special Mode", just simply not feed your pet until his Hunger is low, which results on your pet's Affinity to lower.Once your pet's Affinity is below 70%, your pet will not be in "Special Mode" anymore, though you can obtain it again anytime you wish.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are over 70 pets in Elsword.
